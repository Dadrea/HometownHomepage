## About Project

This web application was apart of Scrimba's [The Frontend Career Path](https://scrimba.com/learn/frontend) journey. The purpose of the project was to generate a homepage for your home town or or the area that you live. I chose to create a Visit Savannah site that could enable others to find a love for the city I call home. The site is written in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It was developed on the JetBrains WebStorm IDE, and deployed via Netlify.

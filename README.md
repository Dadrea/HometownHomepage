## About Project

This web application was apart of Scrimba's [The Frontend Career Path](https://scrimba.com/learn/frontend) journey. 
The purpose of the project was to generate a homepage for your home town or or the area that you live. I chose to create a Visit Savannah site that could enable others to find a love for the city I call home. 
The live site can be viewed [here](https://savannah-hometown-homepage.netlify.app/)

The site is written in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It was developed on the [JetBrains WebStorm IDE](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/) , and deployed via [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).
